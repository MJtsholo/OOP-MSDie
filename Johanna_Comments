+ Assignment 1: Rolling multi-sided die
+
+ Your code looks pretty clean and concise. 
+
+ It would have however been nice to see the setValue method,to set the die
+ to a specific value (i.e cheat). I am only spotting the method for rolling the die(roll) and getting the value of the
+ die(getValue).
+
+
+
+ Assignment 2: Dice Roller widget
+
+ Likewise here the code looks great and so does the dice roller widget, I am loving the background colour, it really
+ grabs one attention.
+ 
+
+
+ Assignment 3: Dice Poker
+
+ The code looks ligit, and the graphical user interface works without any delays nor faults. Once the dice is rolled,
+ you are able to see how much you have left as well as your score.
+  
+ The colour is again striking and grabs ones attention. 
+ 
+ It would be nice though to have some comments added just incase there is someone else to work on your code and maybe
+ they would like to ad or change a certain feature, they would easily know why what is where and why but overall great
+ code!
