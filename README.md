# OOP-MSDie

#### Assignment 1. Rolling multi-sided dice
Description of the task

A normal die (the singular of dice) is a cube, and each face shows a number from one to six. Some games employ nonstandard dice that may have fewer (e.g. four) or more (e.g. thirteen) sides. Let’s design a general class MultiSidedDie to model multi-sided dice. We could use such an object in any number of simulation or game programs. Each MultiSidedDie object will know two things:

    How many sides it has
    Its current value

When a new MultiSidedDie is created, specify how many sides it will have (e.g number_of_sides). The die can be operated on through three provided methods: roll, to set the die to a random value between 1 an number_of_sides, exclusively; set_value, to set the die to a specific value (i.e cheat); and get_value to see what current value is.

#### Assignment 2. Dice roller widget

Build an application that displays and rolls a pair of six-sided dice. Display the buttons graphically and provide two buttons, one for rolling and one for quitting the program. 

Break the application down into the following programs:
- Building the Button
- Building Dice
- The Main Program 

#### Assignment 3: Dice Poker
RULES OF THE GAME

    The player starts with \$100.
    Each round costs \$10 to play. This amount is subtracted from the player’s money at the start of the round.
    The player initially rolls a completely random hand (i.e. all the five dice are rolled).
    The player gets two chances to enhance the hand by re-rolling some or all of the dice.
